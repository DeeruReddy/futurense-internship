It is my first week at Futurense and was filled with a dynamic and engaging introduction to Python programming. My exploration covered a variety of fundamental concepts, ranging from the basics of Python to more intricate tasks such as string and number manipulation, as well as devising methods to retrieve prime numbers through various approaches.

Diving into Python basics likely laid a strong foundation for your understanding of the language. Manipulating strings and numbers is a crucial skill in programming, and it's great to hear that you delved into these areas early on. This knowledge will undoubtedly prove valuable as you tackle more complex tasks in the future.
