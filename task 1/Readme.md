Manipulating tuples poses a challenge due to their immutability; however, despite this constraint, a variety of operations can still be executed on tuples. 

These operations include calculating sums, averages, and performing element-wise multiplication within the tuple structure. 

Despite their immutability, tuples can be leveraged effectively for various computational tasks.

Contained within the uploaded files are processes aimed at determining the average value of tuples and computing the product by multiplying all numbers within a given tuple. These operations showcase the versatility of tuples, even within the realm of immutability, demonstrating their utility in performing essential mathematical computations.

Through these examples, the inherent capabilities of tuples in handling numerical data become evident, underscoring their significance in diverse computational tasks.
