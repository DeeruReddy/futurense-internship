# NETFLIX DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT


This project involves analyzing data related to Netflix, one of the leading streaming platforms globally. The dataset used contains information about Netflix movies and TV shows, including their titles, directors, cast, release year, duration, and genres.

The primary objective of this analysis is to gain insights into Netflix's content library. By exploring various aspects of the dataset, such as trends over time, popular genres, and regional preferences, we aim to understand Netflix's content strategy and audience preferences better.

The dataset used for this analysis is publicly available and can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows). It contains the following features:

- *Show ID*: Unique identifier for each show.
