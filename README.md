List:
In Python, a list is a mutable, ordered collection of elements. Mutable means you can modify the content of a list after it's been created, and ordered means the elements have a specific order.

Tuple:
A tuple is similar to a list but is immutable, meaning you cannot change its content after creation. Tuples are also ordered.

The main feature that differentiates both lists and tuples are:

List: Mutable (can be modified after creation).

Tuple: Immutable (cannot be modified after creation).
