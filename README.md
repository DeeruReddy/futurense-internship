List:
In Python, a list is a mutable, ordered collection of elements. Mutable means you can modify the content of a list after it's been created, and ordered means the elements have a specific order.


Tuple:
A tuple is similar to a list but is immutable, meaning you cannot change its content after creation. Tuples are also ordered.


The main feature that differentiates both lists and tuples are:
List: Mutable (can be modified after creation).
Tuple: Immutable (cannot be modified after creation).


1. Simple Interest (SI) = (p * r * t)/100

p = principle amount

r = rate of interest

t = time periodâ€‹


2. FOR COMPUND INTEREST:

a = p((1)+(r/n))**(nt)

a = future value of the investment/loan, including interest.

p = principle amount

r = rate of interest

t = time period

n = number of times interest is compounded




3. Area of circle = (pi)* (r**2)

r = radius of circle



4. Armstrong Number: An Armstrong number is a special kind of number in math. It's a number that equals the sum of its digits, each raised to a power.
